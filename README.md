# PastesAnalyser
Paste Analyser inspired by AIL-Framework. The idea is to just plug in pastes either from pystemon or the CIRCL feed and searching for keywords using the existing ELK Suite.

#TODO /n
Figure out how to automate zmq pulling from CIRCL feed instead of using pystemon tool. /n
Create automatic Visualisation graphs where keywords can be plugged in.
