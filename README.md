# PastesAnalyser
Paste Analyser inspired by AIL-Framework.

The idea is to just plug in pastes either from pystemon or the CIRCL feed and searching for keywords using the existing ELK Suite.

You will have to customize the ELK dashboards visualisations to show the desired keywords. As provided a total count graph is given and a Windows keyword graph is given. Simply reuse the windows keywords graph and modify the keyword to get the desired keyword match.
